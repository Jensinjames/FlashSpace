## Installation

It's not yet ready for distribution, but you can try it out if you're feeling adventurous!

You need to run the app from Xcode.

## How it works

FlashSpace allows you to define virtual workspaces and assign apps to them. Each workspace is
also assigned to a specific display. When you switch to a workspace, the assigned apps are
automatically presented and all other apps from the assigned display are hidden.

The app allows to switch workspaces on each display independently.

## How to use

1. Create a workspace.
1. Assign apps to the workspace.
1. Assign the workspace to a display.
1. Define a hotkey to switch to the workspace.
1. Save the workspace.

Now you can switch to the workspace using the hotkey you defined.

## Notes

### Workspaces

FlashSpace doesn't manage windows, so if you switch to a workspace and call
another app that is not assigned to the workspace, it will be shown on top of
the workspace apps.

I consider this as a desired behavior, because it allows you quickly access other
apps without glitches or switching between workspaces.

This is a common issue with tiling window managers that they often cause glitches
when a small pop-up window is shown or some unexpected app is opened.

If you want to hide the new app, you can simply use the hotkey again.

### Focus

The last app on the list will be focused when switching to the workspace.

## Limitations

The app is still in early development and has some limitations:

- It doesn't support individual app windows yet.
