ðŸš§ This project is still under development ðŸš§

## Installation

It's not yet ready for distribution, but you can try it out if you're feeling adventurous!

You need to run the app from Xcode.

## How it works

FlashSpace allows you to define virtual workspaces and assign apps to them. Each workspace is
also assigned to a specific display. When you switch to a workspace, the assigned apps are
automatically presented and all other apps from the assigned display are hidden.

The app allows to switch workspaces on each display independently.

## How to use

1. Create a workspace.
1. Assign apps to the workspace.
1. Assign the workspace to a display.
1. Define a hotkey to switch to the workspace.
1. Save the workspace.

Now you can switch to the workspace using the hotkey you defined.

## Limitations

The app is still in early development and has some limitations:

- It doesn't support individual app windows yet.
